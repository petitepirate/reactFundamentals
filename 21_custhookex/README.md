# React Cards
This exercise will give you practice writing your own custom hooks. We’ve provided you with an app, but the code could use some refactoring.

## Step One: Read the Code
Start by downloading the app starter code and getting it set up  

The app uses two APIs, the Deck of Cards API and the Pokemon API, to generate different types of cards on the page.  

Play around with the app to get a sense for how it works. Draw out the component hierarchy in your pair and make sure you understand how all of the pieces fit together.  

## Step Two: useFlip
Both the PokemonCard and the PlayingCard components can be flipped over when clicked on. You may have noticed that there is some duplicate code in these components. Create a hooks.js file in src/, and in that file write a custom hook called useFlip which will hold the business logic for flipping any type of card.  

useFlip doesn’t need to take an argument, and similar to useState, it should return an array with two elements. The first element is the current flip state of the card, and the second element is a function that will toggle the flip state.  

Once you’ve written this hook, refactor PokemonCard and PlayingCard to use this custom hook.  

## Step Three: useAxios in PlayingCardList
In the PlayingCardList component, we initialize an empty array in state, and add to it via an AJAX request we make with axios. Since we use axios in a few components, let’s move this logic into a function called useAxios.  

useAxios should take in a URL, and similar to useState, it should return an array with two elements. The first element is an array of data obtained from previous AJAX requests (since we will add to this array, it’s a piece of state). The second element is a function that will add a new object of data to our array.  

Once you’ve written this hook, refactor PlayingCardList to use this custom hook. (Don’t worry about PokeDex for now - that’s coming in the next part!  

## Step Four: useAxios in PokeDex
PokeDex also make AJAX requests, but this one’s a bit trickier. PlayingCardList makes a request to the same endpoint every time, but the endpoint in PokeDex depends on the name of the pokemon.  

Figure out a way to modify your useAxios hook so that when you call useAxios you can just provide a base url, and when you want to add to your array of response data in state, you can provide the rest of the url.  

Once you’ve done this, refactor PokeDex to use useAxios. Make sure PlayingCardList still works too!  

## This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
